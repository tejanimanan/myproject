    <h1>Tuver na Totha</h1>
    <hr>
    <br><br>
    
    <b><font size="5" color="teal">~~>....Tuver na Totha is simple, spicy and delicious North Gujarati winter recipe. Dry lentil is used to make this simple recipe. I used onion and spring onion with red chili, garlic, ginger to make tuver na totha.

        First time I tasted this recipe at my friend’s farm, then I tried and make frequently at home during winter. Sometime I am using green lentils also. You can add more chili to make it spicier.
        
        I do not like lighter gravy so I added crushed tuver in gravy also. In North Gujarat, it also known as farmer’s food. Normally I serve totha with Rotla or Bread with lemon pickle and garlic chutney.
